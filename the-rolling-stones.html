  <meta name="The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962.
   The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals),
   Keith Richards (lead guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums),
   and Ian Stewart (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a
   touring member until his death in 1985.Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969,
   having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band,
   Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since.
   Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Other touring
   keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (1967–82), Ian McLagan (1978–1981), Billy Preston
  (through the mid-1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982-present). The band was first led by Jones, but after
   teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal
   and personal troubles." content="Rolling Stones English rock Brian Jones Mick Jagger Keith Richards

<p>The Rolling Stones began calling themselves the "World's Greatest Rock&Roll Band" in the Sixties,
and few argued with them — even then. More than 40 years later, the band's music continues to sound
vital. With literally scores of genre-setting hits under the group's belt — and fronted by two of rock's
biggest archetypes — the Rolling Stones have done more to define the look, attitude and sound of rock&roll
than any other band in the genre's history.
