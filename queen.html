  <title>Queen</title>
  <meta name="Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was
  Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals),
  and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock
  and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by
  incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music." content="Queen

      <p>Few bands embodied the pure excess of the '70s like Queen. Embracing the exaggerated pomp of prog rock
        and heavy metal, as well as vaudevillian music hall, the British quartet delved deeply into camp and
        bombast, creating a huge, mock-operatic sound with layered guitars and overdubbed vocals. Queen's music
        was a bizarre yet highly accessible fusion of the macho and the fey. For years, their albums boasted the
        motto "no synthesizers were used on this record," signaling their allegiance with the legions of post-Led
        Zeppelin hard rock bands.
