  <meta name="descrition" content="The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members
  John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as
  the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll,
  the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music
  to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording
  techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as 'Beatlemania', and
  as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and
  McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the
  1960s.">
